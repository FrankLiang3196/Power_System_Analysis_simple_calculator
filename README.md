# Power_System_Analysis_simple_calculator
power grid voltage and flow calculator using Newton-Ralphson method

This program is only used for class demonstration.

Newton-Ralphson mathod is used to calculate the bus voltage. 
Complex matrix calculation are used to simplify the calculation of Jacobi matrix and the unbalanced power.

A user interface is used for easier calculation.
The powergrid information and the output are all saved as txt files.

Run mainwindow to start.

You can load the examples in the example file.
